# What is left to do?

Executive summary:  A _lot_.

Details:

 * *StlwrtObject needs to be implemented:*  In all versions of GTK, instances of
   "objects" are actually implemented as structures that contain data which
   pertains to that instance of the object.  In GTK+ 2 and prior versions, some
   properties of GTK objects could be set or read by accessing members of the
   instance structures themselves.  Though many GTK+ 2 applications do not
   access so-called "public members" of instance structures like this, a lot of
   theme engines, even ones updated relatively recently, still use the public
   members.  The following example of such public member usage is excerpted
   from the code of the Clearlooks theme engine, specifically the file
   `support.c`:
   
        void
        clearlooks_set_toolbar_parameters (ToolbarParameters *toolbar,
                                           GtkWidget *widget,
                                           GdkWindow *window,
                                           gint x, gint y)
        {
        /* [some code deleted because it's not relevant to my argument] */
              if (widget->window == window /* [etc.] */)
                [...]
   
   The above shows the use of the public member `window` from the GtkWidget
   instance pointer `widget`.  And this excerpt is from the `gtk-engines`
   version 2.20.2 source code -- I don't know of any later versions of the
   `gtk-engines` package.
   
   In GTK+ 3, this all changed.  Now instance structures are not supposed to
   contain any public members at all; instead, a lot of instance structures
   contain a pointer to private data.  In ye olde days, an instance structure
   might use 28 bytes; in GTK+ 3 an instance structure is "guaranteed" to use
   at most 8 bytes (possibly 4 if you are using a 32-bit version of GTK).
