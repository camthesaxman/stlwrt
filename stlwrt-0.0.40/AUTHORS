A NOTE ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF THIS FILE:
=======================================

As STLWRT is based around GTK+ 2.24.32, the authors of that version of GTK+ are
partly to be thanked for STLWRT.  However, STLWRT has deviated significantly
from GTK+ and there were too many contributors to GTK+ to list here; therefore
this file lists only people who have contributed directly to STLWRT.  This file
implicitly thanks all who contributed to GTK+ 2, even though no one who
contributed only to GTK+ is listed here.  That doesn't mean, however, that if
you once contributed to GTK+ and you contribute directly to STLWRT that you
won't be listed here.  If anyone believes they've been left off this list,
please file a bug report.

Also, if you add yourself to this list, please keep the list in alphabetical
order, sorted first by surname.  In addition to your name, also add the general
contributions you've made to STLWRT over time (such as "bug fixes", "beta
tester", "general STLWRT fanatic / guru", "project leader", or the like).
