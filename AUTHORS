As the author and maintainer of STLWRT, I'd like to thank all of those who have
contributed to GTK in the past, particularly GTK+ 2 because STLWRT was forked
from GTK+ 2 originally.  This file only contains those people who I know have
contributed to STLWRT itself.  If you have contributed and yet you are not
listed here, please start an issue about it.

As for right now, there is only one person on this list -- yours truly:

Gordon N. Squash
  Original pioneer of STLWRT; current project leader.
